# Data Science & Analytics Virtual Experience Program

## Introduction

Welcome to my Data Science & Analytics Virtual Experience Program! This repository contains all the tasks, projects, and resources I completed during the virtual internship. The program provided me with a real-world experience in the field of data science and analytics.

## Program Overview

The program consisted of several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of data science. I learned how to clean and preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and create data visualizations and reports.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each module, and within each module folder, you will find the tasks, instructions, and data files. I completed each task and committed my changes to the repository.
